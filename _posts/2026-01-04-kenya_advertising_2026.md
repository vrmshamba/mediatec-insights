# Kenya Advertising Shift
## 2026 Strategic Intelligence

89.5 percent of mobile phones in Kenya are smartphones.

Kenya approaches the Digital Inversion point.

Internet advertising grows at 16 percent annually, the fastest rate globally. Traditional broadcast remains relevant, but the gap narrows each quarter.

Precision now outperforms scale.
