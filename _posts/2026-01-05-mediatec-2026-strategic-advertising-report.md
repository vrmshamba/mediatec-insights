### The 70/20/10 Execution Roadmap

##  Critical Failure Points
Competition for attention in 2026 is fatal for inefficient brands:
* **The 5-Minute Window:** If you don't contact a lead within 5 minutes, conversion probability drops by **400%**.
* **Mobile-First or Die:** 75% of traffic is mobile-only; desktop-first sites result in immediate budget waste.
* **Dark Social:** 70% of commerce happens in DMs; ensure you have **Server-Side Tracking (CAPI)** to capture the data.
